A used-vehicle-invoicing-system is a software application that enables manager or salesperson to manage their sales of used vehicles. The system maintains a database of all the vehicles in inventory and their respective details, such as make, model, year, mileage, and price. When a vehicle is booking, the system generates an invoice with all the necessary information.
